    "For the following reasons, using lots of global data with procedural programming is bad doing practie:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Any fuction that uses and/or changes global data cannot eaily be reused in a different program. Any function that accesses global data is operating on data that lives at a differenr (higher) level than the code of the fucntion itself. That function will need a global statement to access this data. You can't just a function that relies on global data and reuse it in another program; it can only reused in a program with similar global data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Many procedural programs tend to have large collections of global variables. By definition, a global variable can be used or changed by any piece of code anywhere in the program. Assignments to global variables are often widely scattered throughout procedural programs, both in the main code and inside functions. Because variable values can change anywhere, it can be extremely difficult to debug and maintain written this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functions written to use global data often have access to too much data. When a function uses a global list, dictionary, or any other global data structure, it has access to all the data in that data structure. However,typically the function should operate on only one piece (or just a small amount) of that data. Having the ability to read and modify any data in a large data structure can lead to errors, such as accidentally using or overwriting data that the function was not intended to touch.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Object-oriented programming can greatly reduce the number of variables required, because a class provides a framework in which data and code that acts on the data exist in one grouping. This also tends to make code easier to debug.\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "In this chapter, I provided an introduction to object-oriented programming by demonstrating the relationship between a class and an object. The class defines the shape and capabilities of an object. An object is a single instance of a class that has its own set of all the data defined in the instance variables of the class. Each piece of data you want an object to contain is stored in an instance variable, which has an object scoppe, meaning that it is available within all methods defined in the class. All objects created from the same class get their own set of all the instance variables, and because these may contain different values, calling the methods on different objects can result in different behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "I showed how you create an object from a class, typically through an assignment statement. After instantiating an object, you can use it to make calls to any method defined in the class of that object. I also showed how you can instantiate multiple objects from the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, the demonstration classes implemented physical objects(light switches, TVs). This is a good way to start understanding the concepts of a class and an object. However, in future chapters, I will introduce objects that do not represent physical objects."
